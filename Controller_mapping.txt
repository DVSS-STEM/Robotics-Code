2 person controls

person 1 (Zeyad):
    - joysticks => mecanum wheel drive controls
        - left joystick movement => translation (forward, backward, left, right, diagonals)
        - right joystick movement=> rotation
        - left joystick press => rotate robot 90° counter clockwise
        - right joystick press => rotate robot 90° clockwise
    - dpad => mecanum wheel fine movement (~10cm in specified direction)
        - up => forward 
        - down => backward
        - right => right
        - left => left
    - button controls => claw controls
        *** x & y buttons switched when coding ***
        - a => close claw
        - b => open claw
        - x => rotate claw counter clockwise (coarse [~0.05 change in position ])
        - y => rotate claw clockwise (coarse [~0.05 change in position ])
    - bumpers => arm rotation controls
        - left bumper => arm rotation towards the back of the robot
        - right bumper => arm rotation towards the front of the robot
    - triggers => (N/A)

person 2 (Thomas):
    - joysticks => (N/A)
    - dpad =>
    - button controls => claw fine adjustment controls
        *** x & y buttons switched when coding ***
        - a => "tighten" claw (i.e fine control over claw closing [~0.025 change in position ])
        - b => "loosen" claw (i.e fine control over claw opening [~0.025 change in position ])
        - x => rotate claw counter clockwise (fine [~0.025 change in position ])
        - y => rotate claw clockwise (fine [~0.025 change in position ])
    - bumpers =>
    - triggers =>
